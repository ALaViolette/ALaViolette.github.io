				<h2>Women must be present</h2>
				<p>Women make up 59%  of the US labor force based on numbers published by the US Census Bureau. When looking at tech giants such as Google, Amazon, Twitter and Mircosoft women make up 30% of their workforce. The number of women in tech postions at these companies drops down to 15.6% based on numbers released in 2015.</p>
            
            	<p>At Michigan Women Code we want to encourage women to be apart of change. This site is designed to help women who are interested or apart of tech grow. </p>
